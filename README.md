## 📘Project Description
The **Smart Comfort Monitoring System (SCMS)** offers an **affordable**, **adaptive**, and **intelligent** monitoring system for small laboratories and middle-class households.

The system can continuously measure:
- 🌡️ **Temperature**
- 💧 **Humidity**
- ☀️ **Light intensity**
- 🌫️ **Air quality**

All the measurements are:
- Stored on an **SD Card**
- Displayed on a **Local Web Interface**
- Evaluated by a **lightweight embedded AI** that can give the *comfort score*

---

## Features
- Reading sensors using **ADC** & **I2C**
- Evaluating data with an **Embedded AI**
- Store the data on **SD Card**
- Serve **Live Data** via **Local Website**
- Giving **Audio Feedback** using **DAC**
- Controlling **LED Brightness** via **PWM**
- Having a **Menu Interface on LCD**
- Maintain **USB Comminication** with PC
